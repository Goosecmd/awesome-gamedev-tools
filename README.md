# awesome-gamedev-tools
Simply a college project, but a collection of 10 Game Development Tools, _mainly game engines_ as uncommon as I could get :]

# | Found on Github |
## 1. Shaderc
A shader testing tool, and collection of other tools and libraries for shaders
[Shaderc's Github Page](github.com/google/shaderc)

## 2. o3de
3D game engine, allows the dev to make "cinema quality 3D worlds", with "no fees or commercial obligations", just overly fancy way of saying free

## 3. Filament
"Real-time physically based rendering engine" for many platforms, like Android, Linux, Windows, etc. Made specifically with Android in mind, so made to be as efficient as possible on it.

## 4. Cortex
Several libraries to help aid VFX software dev

# | Have their own sites |

## 5. C4 Engine
Very unlike literal C4(the explosive), instead is an engine used for game across many platforms, i.e. Xbox, Playstation, and PC

## 6. Gamebryo
Toolset for gamedev, allows "rapid prototyping", which I presume it allows for quick tests, like playing the game while making it in real time

## 7. FlaxEngine
A 3D game engine, written in C++ & C#, with wonderful graphics and strong scripting capabilities
[FlaxEngine's Site](www.flaxengine.com)

## 8. CRYENGINE
A seemingly active updating game engine with plenty of documentation

## 9. Roblox Studio
Allows for creating unique "experiences" for the larger game/host of games *Roblox*, with some default assets, and ability to make your own
[Roblox Studio's Site](create.roblox.com/landing)

## 10. Godot
A much larger game engine as of now(9/6/25), but *was* and kind of still is one of the underdogs for game engines
