# awesome-gamedev-tools
Simply a college project, but a collection of 10 Game Development Tools, as uncommon as I could get :]

# 1. C4 Engine
Very unlike literal C4(the explosive), instead is an engine used for game across many platforms, i.e. Xbox, Playstation, and PC

# 2. Gamebryo
Toolset for gamedev, allows "rapid prototyping", which so far I presume it allows for quick tests, like playing the game while making it in real time

# 3. o3de
3D game engine, put more in here silly









# ??. Godot
A much larger game engine as of now(9/4/25), but *was* and kind of still is one of the underdogs
